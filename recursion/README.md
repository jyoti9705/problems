Recursion
1. Recursion is when we the method keeps calling itself, something like when we share screen on skype
2. It basically means defining problem in terms of itself
3. Recursion work with stack i.e. it keeps calling itself and stores data or calculation in stack until it reaches the base case from where it will exit the loop
4. Base case if required otherwise your method can go in infinite loop and consume a huge amount of memory
5. In Recursion each time when it executes itself it consumes memory for the variables that are going in input and hence if base condition is not there you can go into out of memory errors.
